   * @brief Specialized hash functor for pointer types to get rid of the alignment.
   * 
   * Pointers are usually aligned, with the alignment depending on the type they
   * point to. This means that the lower bits of the pointer are zero.
   * Many hash maps calculate the bucket index using a modulo by a power of two,
   * because this is simply a logical `and` operation. However, by using this
   * approach with aligned pointers the lower buckets never get populated. To
   * avoid this problem and achieve a better distribution in such hash maps, this
   * specialization shifts the `size_t` representation of the pointer to the right
   * by \a X bits, where \a X is calculated based on the alignment of `Key`.
