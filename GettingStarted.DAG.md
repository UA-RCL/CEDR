# DAG-Based CEDR - Getting Started

In this example workflow, we will familiarize ourselves with setting up our system to run Hand-crafted DAG-based applications on CEDR

We will begin by first building and running on an x86_64 system with no accelerators, and then we will discuss execution on an aarch64-based ZCU102 FPGA with accelerators.
