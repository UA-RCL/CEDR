# need to use cython --embed to make it work...
# also need to edit the code so it converts the main into just a bare call to the __Pyx_main(0, NULL)
# something about the CEDR argc/argv handling is wacky tacky....
# needed to modify src-api/dag_handle.cpp with an RTLD_GLOBAL on the dlopen so that all the loaded libraries that get yanked in can be loaded at runtime
